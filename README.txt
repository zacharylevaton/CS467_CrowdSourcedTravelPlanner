To start the server, use the command "python3 app.py" in the main directory.

NOTE: According to Video 4 of the Flask Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYWiDiIUxQc), the "site.db" 
database file should be created in the main "CrowdSourcedTravelPlanner" folder.  I use a virtual Python 
environment, and it creates the file in the "CrowdSourcedTravelPlanner/instance" folder.  I included the 
"site.db" file in both locations, as I'm not sure which one will be used when testing on other machines.
